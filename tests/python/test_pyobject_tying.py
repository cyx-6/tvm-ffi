"""Tests for the PyObject-tying feature (cache & revive).

A 16-byte ``PyCustomAllocHeader`` is prepended to every Object that goes
through the Python custom allocator. Its ``tagged_pyobj`` field is a tagged
pointer to the canonical Python wrapper, encoding a three-state machine
driven by the custom ``tp_alloc`` / ``tp_free`` slots and the
``make_ret_object`` dispatcher in ``tvm_ffi_python_helpers.h``:

  Detached  no Python wrapper bound to the chandle (raw == NULL)
  Active    canonical wrapper alive; ``wrapper.chandle == chandle`` (tag 0)
  Inactive  wrapper dropped but its memory is cached as a dead,
            untracked allocation (tag 1); revived in place at the same address
            on the next ``make_ret_object``

Active gives ``a.x is a.x``. Inactive gives stable ``id()`` across a
drop-then-rewrap cycle when the C++ object outlives the wrapper — without a
leak: the cached allocation is revived (``tp_alloc``), not resurrected.

Note: some class/method names below retain the older "StateB" (Active) and
"StateC" (Inactive) labels from the resurrection-era design; the behavior they
assert is unchanged under cache & revive.
